Certainly the finest portrait of Charles I. in existence.  It shows
Van Dyck in his most attractive aspect as a painter of the
aristocracy.  Executed before the marked decline in his technical powers,
which marred, from an artistic standpoint, the later pictures of his
English period, it yet possesses the dignity and distinction he knew
so well how to infuse in portraying the nobility of our country.  It
is one of the best examples of the artist's powers as a colourist, and
as such will bear comparison with the productions of the mighty
Venetians.

<h4>
THE EARLY DAYS
</h4>

<p>
No painter has remained more
consistently in favour with both artists
and the public than Van Dyck.  His art
marks the highest achievement of Flanders
of the seventeenth century.  In making this
statement the claims of Rubens have not
been overlooked, although the latter has
been, and probably will always be,
considered the head of the Flemish school.
</p>

<p>
It is perhaps not too much to say that
Van Dyck possessed in a greater measure
than Rubens those qualities which go to
make a great artist.  We can never
overlook the seniority of the latter, and to
him will always belong the credit of
having evolved the style which revolutionised
the art of a nation, and there is
no doubt that the pupil owed to him much
of the knowledge he so well utilised in
after-life.

<p>
In comparing those two great men it
would be well, at first, to rid ourselves of
the confusion which often arises through
the application of the terms "artist" and
"painter."  In relation to painting they are
only too often considered synonymous, but
a little consideration will show us that a
man whose technical abilities are of a high
order need not necessarily be a great artist.
In fact, one of the most truthful charges
urged against the best contemporary art is
that it demonstrates an astonishing poverty
of invention, a lack of message, if you will,
coupled with an extraordinarily highly
developed technique.  To screen as much as
possible the dilemma in which he finds
himself, many a modern painter has recourse
to creating those outbursts of meaningless
eccentricity that are so familiar upon the
walls of our exhibitions.  It is true that
some few of the men who are living to-day
are equipped almost, if not quite, as well
technically as the great majority of the old
masters.  In a word, they could meet them
on nearly equal terms as painters, but they
lack invention and conception in which to
bring their powers into legitimate play, and
consequently they cannot rank with them
as artists.
</p>

<p>
It was in the possession of these very
qualities that Van Dyck surpassed Rubens.
I do not suggest that the latter was devoid of
power of conception, for, if I did, would not the
great "Coup-de-lance" at Antwerp, or the
"Fall of the Damned" at Munich (the drawing
for the latter in the National Gallery gives
an even better idea than the finished picture)
be there to refute me?  Van Dyck, however,
though being quite the match of Rubens in
technique, even in his early days&mdash;though still
working under him&mdash;surpassed him in his
middle period.  Anybody who has closely
studied the noble religious pictures at
Courtrai and Malines&mdash;the latter, unfortunately,
irreparably injured by damp and neglect&mdash;can
but be impressed with his stupendous power
in this direction.  Granted that he does not
appeal in the same measure to our emotions
from the spiritual side as do the early painters
of Italy and Flanders, he yet brings the brutal
aspect of the scene before us in an intensely
human manner.
</p>

<p>
In most subject pictures Van Dyck painted
before his visit to Italy it is apparent that
Rubens had been his sole guide, and he was
impelled only with a desire to emulate his
master.  But, after his return, the influence
of the mighty painters he had studied south
of the Alps had wrought a wondrous change
in his method, and although he found himself
back again amidst his old surroundings he
never quite forsook the path he had been
treading in the interval.  Rubens, who had
also spent some years in Italy, did not submit
to the influence of the southern masters in
the same measure, but remained a Fleming
to the end.  There is little alteration to be
observed, either in his historical and sacred
pictures or in his portraits, after he had
studied the Italians.  From this we may
assume either that Rubens was less
susceptible to extraneous influences, or that
he considered his method quite the equal to
any that he had seen.  Van Dyck, on the
other hand, absorbed, particularly from the
Venetians, certain qualities which he
employed ceaselessly throughout the remainder
of his life.  It was not, however, solely this
cause which raised Van Dyck as an artist
above his master.  Rather was it to be
attributed to the superiority of temperament.
Thus, whilst we can still consider
Rubens the head of the Flemish school
of the seventeenth century, we should
accord to Van Dyck the foremost rank as
an artist.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Van Dyck was born at Antwerp
on March 22nd, 1599.  It was said formerly
that his father, Frans Van Dyck, was a
painter on glass, but later research has
disclosed the fact that he carried on business
as a merchant.  His mother practised the
art of embroidery with no mean skill, and
her works appear to have been held in
considerable esteem.  The young painter
had, however, the misfortune of losing her
when he arrived at the age of eight.  We
know but little of his early years, but
he must have shown considerable aptitude
for drawing, for we find him already the
pupil of Hendrik van Balen in 1609.  The
latter painter had received instruction in
his art from Adam van Oort, the master of
Rubens, but he utilised the instruction he
had received in a very different way from
that of his fellow-pupil.  He studied in Italy
for some time, and upon his return to
Antwerp became one of the most popular
painters in the city.  Several works still
remaining there testify that his sojourn
in the South had not entirely effaced his
Flemish training.  He excelled particularly
in cabinet pictures, with subjects inspired
by the classics, in which the landscapes were
sometimes painted by Jan Brueghel.  These
are wrought with wonderful finish, and
were much admired by his contemporaries
for the purity of their colouring.  At the
same time, whilst being a good craftsman
and filling an honourable position in the
history of the school, it cannot be claimed
that he possessed genius in an extraordinary
degree.
</p>

<p>
It is probable, however, that a more
suitable master for the young Van Dyck
could not have been found.  In the studio
of so staid and sober a painter he would
not be brought into contact with any of
those pyrotechnics which have wrought
such havoc with the art of young artists
when encountered at the onset of their
careers.  On the other hand, Van Balen is
likely to have insisted upon great care
being exercised in drawing and in the
finishing of minutest detail.  Such rigid
training is excellent, for whilst it does not
hinder further developments upon other
lines in the least degree, it insures that
all future progress shall be built upon a
solid foundation.
</p>

<p>
At this time, however, Rubens, having
returned from his wanderings in Italy and
Spain, had settled in Antwerp.  His new
position as Court painter to the Archduke
Albert and the Archduchess Isabella brought
him into great prominence and insured him
constant occupation.  Even at this early
period his art was approaching maturity,
and if he had not yet developed the dazzling
brilliancy and facility of his later time, he
was still far ahead of any painter modern
Flanders had produced.  We have only to
contemplate the works of his contemporaries,
and those who immediately preceded
him, to imagine what a profound sensation
this young man created in Antwerp.  It
seldom fell to the lot of an artist who was
but just over thirty to have been in the
service of such an illustrious personage as
the Duke of Mantua.  The latter, moreover,
so highly esteemed his talent that he wished
him to return to his service even after he
had returned to Antwerp.  Further, the
Duke had such confidence in Rubens'
diplomatic ability that he sent him upon
important business to Philip III. in Madrid.
The experience he had gained both in Italy
and in Spain, where he had seen and copied
many of the greatest works of the Italian
Renaissance, served to develop a genius
which in itself was of the first order, and
the fruits were immediately visible upon his
arrival in Antwerp.  We can well picture
to ourselves the effect of the masculine
vigour, nay, more, the bravado of his
brush-work upon the staid and homely Flemish
artists.  Their minuteness of finish, delicacy,
cool transparencies and silveriness of
colouring seem indeed <i>petit</i> when pitted against
the irrepressible dash and golden palette
of Rubens.  In spite of this he appears
not to have created any enemies.  On the
contrary, his fellow-artists seem to have
recognised his superiority, and many were
influenced by his method.  To estimate to
the full the revolution he wrought we must
compare the masters whom we found
installed in favour in Flanders with the school
he so soon created.  The older painters being
affected in so visible a degree, we can quite
imagine how easily one so young and
impressionable as Van Dyck would submit to
the new influence.  Here was a master
whose art, glowing with the full-blooded
vigour of Italy, yet retained the healthy
freshness of his native country.  Restrained and
held in leash as he would be in the studio
of Van Balen, we can sympathise with his
yearning to migrate to that of Rubens.  He
speedily joined that ever-swelling body of
artists who gathered themselves round the
great master.  For some years he worked
side by side with Snyders and Seghers.  The
progress he made during this time was
considerable; indeed, it is frequently difficult to
decide whether certain pictures produced in
these years are the work of the master or
the pupil, so thoroughly had he acquired
Rubens' technique.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In connection with this a story, the
details of which have frequently been
challenged, is told.  It is said that Rubens,
leaving his studio one day to take a
walk, had left a picture in the process of
painting upon his easel.  The students
were anxious to inspect it and observe the
method he was employing.  Finally, they
induced his servant to admit them.  Being a
numerous crowd, some amount of struggling
took place to get near the canvas.  The
result was that one of them, it is said Van
Diepenbeck, fell against the canvas and
injured the picture.  Dismay spread
throughout the room.  When they had recovered
their presence of mind, some one proposed
that the damage should be repaired before
Rubens returned.  By common consent
Van Dyck was chosen, and he set to work
with a will.  Upon Rubens entering his
studio next morning, surrounded by his
pupils, he selected the repaired part and
said that that was by no means the worst
piece he had painted the day before.
Upon a closer examination the damage
revealed itself, but so cleverly had Van
Dyck performed his task that Rubens
decided to leave it as it was.
</p>

<p>
From such tales as this has arisen the
tradition that Rubens became so jealous of
his pupil that he endeavoured to persuade
him to abandon historical painting and
devote the whole of his time to portraiture.
Such statements are not only in opposition
to all that we know of Rubens' character,
but there is the further evidence
that when he finally parted from Van
Dyck they were on the very best of
terms.  Indeed, Rubens went so far as to
make him a present of one of his finest
horses for the purpose of his journey
in Italy, whilst Van Dyck left with his
master a portrait of Rubens' wife as a
souvenir.
</p>

<p>
He further retained the services of Van
Dyck as his assistant, which he would not
have done had any jealousy existed between
them.  It was probably the pressure of
commissions, which flowed in upon him in
innumerable quantities, that induced him to
take this step.  It was quite impossible for
the master himself to accomplish all the
work he undertook.  Outside Italy he was
the first master to employ his school as a
sort of manufactory on a large scale.  So
well did he train his assistants that he had
only to make the sketch himself, and to
superintend its painting, for a large work
to be turned out in an incredibly short
time.  As Van Dyck was his most capable
assistant, he would certainly employ him
upon the important parts, and as it has
already been pointed out that it is difficult
to differentiate between the works of the
two men at this time, it would be still
more difficult to decide definitely what hand
Van Dyck had in the large number of
religious and historical pictures that were
being sent out under Rubens' name at this
time.
</p>

<p>
During this period, however, Van Dyck
had acquired a reputation of his own.  He
had been elected a master of the Antwerp
Corporation of painters in 1618, that is,
whilst still in his twentieth year.

<h3>

<h4>
THE JOURNEY TO ITALY
</h4>

<p>
It was the habit of most Northern artists at
that time to make a journey in Italy.  The
renown of the works created during the
preceding two centuries by the Italian
Renaissance had spread all over Europe, and no
young artist considered his education
complete without having spent a few years in
studying them.  Moreover, they found that
patrons patronised them better if they had
been through this Italian training.  These
ideas were rather dictated by the prevailing
fashion than by any solid good to be derived
by the artist who underwent it.  We have
innumerable examples of Dutchmen and
Flemings whose natural genius became perverted
upon Italian soil.  Nicholas Berchem and
Karl Dujardin were striking examples of
the sad results which frequently accrued
from thus transplanting themselves into a
country with which their temperament had
nothing in common.  It is probable that
had Karl Dujardin remained in Holland,
the world would have been enriched by a
landscape painter of the first order, for he
had gifts far above even the average painter
of his time.  But immediately on reaching
Italy he succumbed to the influences
surrounding him, and endeavoured to get rid as
far as possible of his early training, and to
see things and render them in the Italian
way.  The result was, that whilst he never
threw off the Dutch character of his scenes
and figures, he enveloped them with a
conventional atmosphere as monotonous as
it is untrue.
</p>

<p>
We have already seen the results the
Italian journey had upon Rubens.  There was
no inducement for Van Dyck, comparing, as
he would be able to, his master's pictures
painted before his journey to Italy and those
which he executed afterwards, to undertake
the same trouble.  It is rather to be thought
that he was decided to see the artistic Mecca
for himself, by the glowing accounts of its
treasures that he heard from time to time
from Rubens' own lips.  For the latter, small
as had been the influence of the great Italian
masters upon his work, was nevertheless of
a disposition peculiarly adapted for keenly
appreciating merit whenever it was brought
under his notice.  We can quite imagine that
during those early days in Antwerp his pupils
whilst at work would hear innumerable
accounts of the beauties of this or that picture,
and the more enthusiastic of them would
consequently only be the more eager to judge of
its beauties for themselves.  During the
execution of the large canvasses that were turned
out in such quantities from the studio, Rubens
doubtlessly prefaced alterations he made by
referring to many a master's method, and
recounted how the masterpieces upon which
his comments were framed had been brought
to completion.
</p>

<p>
During the latter portion of the time Van
Dyck stopped with Rubens he was only
acting as his assistant, and consequently
would be free to leave when he liked.  He
would probably be quite aware that his
technique was the equal of his master's, and
would realise that he had received all the
tuition he possibly could in his present
situation.  Ambitious as he was, there is
no doubt that he yearned for an opportunity
to learn for himself the message the great
masters had to impart to him.  Whilst we
can quite imagine that Rubens would be
sorry to part with so capable an assistant,
there was not any evidence that he did
not do everything in his power to assist
him to carry out his project.
</p>

<p>
In 1623&mdash;when he was but twenty-four
years of age&mdash;Van Dyck left Antwerp on his
journey southward.  He appears not to have
got any further than a village near Brussels,
where he succumbed to the attractions of
a certain young lady named Annah van
Ophem.  At her instigation he painted two
pictures for the parish church there.  In
one, representing St. Martin sharing his
cloak with a beggar, he took himself as a
model for the saint.  The parish authorities
being, it is said, of a mercenary turn of
mind, had it valued, and, hearing that it
was worth 4000 florins, sold it to a
M. Hoët.  The people of the village, however,
hearing of the sale, determined to prevent
the removal of the picture at all costs,
and when the purchaser arrived he found
not only the peasants, but their wives
and children, armed, and was obliged to
escape ignominiously through the priest's
garden and return to Brussels without his
prize.  Whilst still residing at the village,
Van Dyck painted the portrait of Annah van
Ophem, surrounded with the dogs belonging
to the Infanta Isabella, of which either she
or her father had charge, and a picture of
the Holy Family, in which she figured as
the principal personage.

life and gaiety, his joyous face gives us a good idea of the
gratification he found in life almost to the end.  Indeed, a deal of the
fascination of his art arises from his approaching his subjects in
this happy frame of mind.

<p>
Rubens, hearing of the prolonged
sojourn of his pupil at Saveltheim, arrived
one day upon the scene, and finally
induced Van Dyck to tear himself from
his mistress and continue his journey to
Italy.
</p>

<p>
The great object of his visit was to study
the Venetian masters, and accordingly he
repaired forthwith to the City of the Lagoons.
We can picture him standing for the first
time before those wonderful portraits of
Titian and Tintoretto, Palma-Vecchio and
Moroni, about which he had heard so much
in his student days in Antwerp.  That he
was not disappointed is evidenced by the
fact that almost immediately a change is
observable in his method.  He cast aside
as speedily as possible the silveriness and
coolness which had characterised his palette
when working in Antwerp, and endeavoured
to assimilate in as great a degree as possible
the golden luminosity and subtle handling
of the mighty Venetians.  It is probable that
Titian held the first place in his estimation,
for it is rather upon his method that all his
subsequent developments in technique are
based.  But perhaps full justice has not
been done to the influence Moroni had in
moulding his youthful genius.  One has only
to compare, for example, the full-length
portrait of an Italian nobleman, No. 1316 in
the National Gallery, with that marvellous
representation of Philip le Roy in the
Wallace Collection, reproduced in this volume,
to see the connection between the two
painters.  There is the same air of distinction
in each portrait, and in silveriness of
colouring and elegance of pose there is much in
common.  These are not isolated examples
in the life-work of the two masters,
but are rather representative of a whole
series of portraits in which their genius runs
on nearly parallel lines.
</p>

<p>
We cannot wonder that Van Dyck was
not much impressed by such of the Umbrian
painters as he came in contact with.  There
was still left in these men the remains of that
mysticism which was born of the intimate
contact with religion in relation to life that
had originally brought it into being.  The
religious art of the Netherlands&mdash;I am
speaking now of that which arose after the
middle of the sixteenth century&mdash;was built
upon a purely human and materialistic basis.
If a scriptural scene was represented it was
brought before us as a subject from everyday
life; a martyrdom with all its brutality,
a crucifixion with all its physical horror, and
a madonna and child simply as a peasant
girl with a child, set in homely surroundings.
Our artist, endowed with the same temperament
as the men who had created such
works, and who moreover was perhaps the
best exponent of this school of painting, with
the possible exception of Rubens himself,
could not be expected to be touched with
the subtleties of Botticelli or Filippino Lippi.
Further, it is not unlikely that he found
he could learn little from the technique of
Raphael or Andrea del Sarto.  But with
the Venetians it was quite otherwise.  From
the early days of Giovanni Bellini they
seem to have treated religious subjects in
just as materialistic a manner, if less grossly
and repugnantly, than the Flemings
themselves.  One has but to contemplate the
life-work of Titian to see how little religious
feeling, in the Florentine or mystical sense
of the term, there was in his art.  Even the
two most impressive religious pictures he ever
painted, the "Entombment," in the Louvre,
and the "Christ crowned with Thorns," at
Munich, would certainly not have pleased
the patrons of Ghirlandajo or Pollaiuolo.
But Titian and his contemporaries constitute
the zenith attained by Italian materialistic
art, at any rate in point of technique.

<p class="caption">
The masterpiece of Van Dyck's second Flemish manner.  In it we
see the culmination of the influences he had brought away with him
from Italy sobered by a renewed contact with the productions of
his illustrious master.  The dignity of pose, probably derived from
Moroni and Titian, united with the fact that his immense technical
powers are brought into play in an unsurpassed degree, certainly
proclaim it as one of the greatest portraits in the world.  Van Dyck
executed an etching of Philippe le Roy, probably based upon this
portrait which ranks very high amongst his productions in this
way.

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is more than probable that Van Dyck
found certain points in his master's method
crude compared with that of the Venetians,
and although, as we shall see later, he
endeavoured after his return to Flanders to
retrace his steps in a measure, the influences
he brought away with him from Italy
remained during his whole life.
</p>

<p>
He went from Venice to Genoa, and there
his style created such an impression that
he found many of the nobility eager to have
their portraits painted by him.  Formerly,
his Italian manner, as it is called, was to be
best studied in that city, but as years have
rolled on many of the finest examples have
become scattered over Europe and America.
The two fine portraits recently added to
the National Gallery date from this period,
and although, owing to their condition, they
do not set forth his talents at their best,
will give a good idea of the changes his
method had undergone since he left Antwerp.
Two of the noblest portraits of the Genoese
period were formerly in the collection of Sir
Robert Peel, but, after being sold at auction
in London some few years ago, finally found
a permanent home in the Berlin Gallery.
</p>

<p>
From Genoa he went to Rome, and, his
reputation having preceded him, he was
soon loaded with commissions for both
historical subjects and portraits.  It is said,
however, that his residence here was
rendered unpleasant by a number of artists
persecuting him by reason of his not wishing
to fall in with their methods of life.  Be
this as it may, he returned to Genoa, and
after some time departed for Palermo; but
the plague breaking out, some time after his
arrival, he determined to return to Flanders.
Van Dyck had reason to congratulate
himself, not only upon the amount of benefit
which he had received from his sojourn in
Italy, but also on account of the flattering
manner in which he had been received
everywhere.  His complete success in these two
respects was calculated to infuse confidence
in him for the future.  He was now fully
equipped in every way, and his good luck
in the matter of patronage, so lavishly
bestowed upon him in Italy, was destined to
pursue him in his future career, until finally
the immense amount of work he undertook
in consequence had an adverse influence
upon his later productions.
</p>

<h4>
THE SECOND FLEMISH MANNER
</h4>

<p>
The reputation of Van Dyck, great as it
was prior to leaving Antwerp, had
materially grown during his absence in Italy.
From time to time reports reached his
fellow-townsmen of the brilliant success he was
achieving there, the high personages with
whom he was mingling, and the flattering
praise accorded to his productions.  We may
be sure that returning travellers would relate
the astonishing progress he was making, and
consequently his friends would await with
eager anticipation the proofs of all they had
heard.  There could be no doubt that Rubens
would be amongst those who would be most
interested in his progress, and he would
be curious to see the influence the Italians
had exercised upon his technique.
</p>

<p>
His talents were soon put to the essay in
the form of a commission for a large picture
representing St. Augustine in ecstasy,
surrounded by angels and saints, for the Church
of the Augustines in Antwerp.  As a result
of this first effort, both his patrons and the
public were delighted, and commissions for
works of a similar character flowed in upon
him from every side.
</p>

<p>
Rubens had fairly early in his career
instituted an ingenious method for making
his works widely known.  He employed,
under his own direction, a number of
engravers whose names have become
household words.  Technically considered, they
were as well equipped as any who have ever
lived.  The names of Paul Pontius, Lucas
Vorsterman, the two Bolswerts, Peter de
Jode are held in reverence by every admirer
of engraving.  Their remarkable fidelity in
transcribing the works of Rubens render it
frequently unnecessary to see the originals
themselves in order thoroughly to study
them.  I am perhaps not going too far when
I say that they understood the art of
translating colour effects into black and white in
a manner unknown previous to their time
and never surpassed afterwards.  The tone
values of the paintings themselves are
preserved.  There is no doubt that this excellence
was due to the guidance of Rubens.  He
superintended each plate in process of
preparation and rectified with his own hand any
errors that might have crept in.  In this way
Rubens rendered an immense service to art.
Quantities of these prints went out to foreign
countries and were prized by both artists
and collectors, serving to stimulate the former
to renewed efforts and to improve the taste
of the latter.  At the same time, he is to
be credited with having brought the
engraving art to a pitch which has never been
surpassed.
</p>

<p>
When Rubens saw of what his pupil was
now capable, he immediately turned the
attention of his engravers to his works, and
until Van Dyck practically ceased historical
painting, we have as many plates worked
after his designs as from those of his master.
It was soon after his return to Antwerp that
he received the commission to paint the
celebrated picture at Malines representing the
Crucifixion.  Of this remarkable canvas we
can but form an inadequate idea to-day.  The
exceeding negligence with which it has been
kept, coupled with the continual covering up
of the picture, thus depriving it of light, which
every oil-painting requires for its preservation,
has contributed to render it a wreck of its
former self.  The subject, to which we are
so accustomed that we are but little moved
when we encounter it in the great galleries,
is here presented to us in a most terrible
and essentially human aspect.  The
extraordinary expression of physical pain infused
into the heads of the two thieves, one on
each side of Christ, together with the energy
of their efforts to detach themselves from
their awful position, will cause a shudder to
creep over even the most phlegmatic person.
This is foiled by the superb treatment of
the head of the Saviour.  In the latter is an
extraordinary mixture of pain, mental and
physical, combined with a sublime look of
resignation.  Sir Joshua Reynolds regarded
it as one of the masterpieces of the world,
and there will be not a few who will concur
in his judgment.
</p>

<p>
Van Dyck was not, however, content
simply to exercise his powers in this way.
An innumerable series of portraits date from
this time, notably the well-known series
representing the most prominent contemporary
artists of Flanders.  These productions are
well known from the engravings executed
after them; the originals are now distributed
throughout the world.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Van Dyck's position in the
Netherlands, in spite of the quantity of
patronage bestowed upon him, was anything but
pleasant.  The jealousy of his rivals was
particularly irksome to a man of his disposition.
In the intrigues with which he was surrounded
Rubens had no part; on the contrary, he
always sustained the cause of his brilliant
pupil with the utmost enthusiasm and fidelity,
and it is probable, in view of this fact
and the renown which Van Dyck himself
had attained, that he would have worn down
the opposition and caused the calumnies
with which he was beset to fall upon the
heads of their originators.  But the taste
for travel which he had developed in Italy
probably impelled him to seek relief outside
his own country.  Accordingly we find him
employed at the Hague&mdash;certainly not a great
distance from the seat of his recent troubles,
but sufficiently far to remove him from their
reach.  Here he painted the portrait of the
Prince of Orange and innumerable
personages of his Court, in addition to
receiving ample encouragement from the foreign
ambassadors.
</p>

<p>
It was not, however, to be expected that
so small a city with its limited scope would
long suffice for a man of his ambitions.  His
eyes were set upon England.

PLATE VI.&mdash;PORTRAIT OF ONE OF CHARLES I.'S CHILDREN

Possibly the best known and one of the most deservedly popular

<p>
The encouragement which Charles I. extended
to the fine arts, and his liberality
in patronising them, induced him to think
that a suitable field for the exercise of his
talents was open to him in our country.
Accordingly about 1632 he arrived in London.
England was not, however, quite strange to
him, for about eleven years previously&mdash;that is,
before his departure to Italy&mdash;he had already
been here upon a visit.  Upon this occasion,
however, he does not appear to have
succeeded in attracting the attentions of the
king, and consequently he did not meet
with the success he had counted upon.
Remaining but a few months, he decided
to return to Antwerp, fully resolved to make
it a permanent place of abode.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, however, Rubens had been
sent by the Infanta Isabella on a diplomatic
visit to Charles, who received him in the
most gracious manner and created him a
knight.  The flattering attentions bestowed
upon Rubens during his stay, coupled with
his estimation of the king's character and
taste, created a most favourable impression
upon him, and when he returned to Antwerp
he probably dispelled in a measure Van
Dyck's antipathy to our country.
Meanwhile Charles had seen the latter's portrait
of Nicholas Lanière, his chapel master, and
was so impressed with its qualities that he
sent an invitation to Van Dyck to return.
</p>

<p>
An opportunity so favourable to advancement
was not lightly to be passed over,
and Van Dyck decided once more to try his
fortune here.
</p>

<p>
This decision constituted a turning-point
in the life and style of the artist, and we
shall see him in England passing the most
prosperous years of his life.

<h4>
VAN DYCK IN ENGLAND
</h4>

<p>
There never was a time in the history
of the English Court when such opportunities
for advancement were presented to an artist
possessing the genius of Van Dyck as
during the reign of Charles I.  He was one
of the few monarchs of England who
recognised the civilising influence of art on
the nation and encouraged it in a manner
quite beyond his means.  It mattered not
of what period, school, or nationality a work
happened to be, so long as it possessed a
high degree of merit, it appealed strongly
to the king.  We have only to consider the
superb collection he brought together, only
to be ruthlessly dispersed by the Commonwealth,
to gauge the refinement of his taste.
Many of the priceless possessions of foreign
galleries formed part of his collection, and
if England had only been in a position to
retain her hold upon them we should no
doubt to-day be in possession of the finest
assemblage of Italian art in the world.
I need only enumerate the sumptuous
portrait of Alfonso of Ferrara and Laura d'Dianti
and the "Entombment," by Titian, in the
Louvre; the portrait of Erasmus, by Holbein,
in the Louvre, and the marvellous portrait of
a young woman, for so many years wrongly
ascribed to the same master, at the Hague;
the portrait of Albrecht Dürer by himself in
the Prado, and the two masterpieces by
Geertgen van St. Jans in the Imperial
Gallery at Vienna, to demonstrate the quality
of his many possessions.  In England we
still have retained a few of his treasures.
Conspicuous among them are those
masterpieces of Andrea Mantegna, the "Triumph
of Julius Cæsar," at Hampton Court, the
Albrecht Dürer, and the Lorenzo Lotto,
in the same gallery, together with the
"Mercury, Cupid and Venus," by Correggio,
in the National Gallery.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say that a collector, who
had sufficient taste to bring together such
a notable assemblage, would demand a
very high degree of talent indeed in a
painter who was working for the Court.
Charles had, moreover, been brought into
contact with the brilliant achievements of
Rubens, and would in consequence expect
a great deal from a pupil whose merits he
had heard so extolled.
</p>

<p>
The portrait of Nicholas Lanière appealed
to him immediately.  He saw in Van Dyck
a man whose performances, even at this
early age, far surpassed those of any painter
then working in England.  Charles, who
immensely admired the portraits of Rubens,
saw in those of his pupil an Italian quality
lacking in the former, and this would
additionally attract him.
</p>

<p>
Van Dyck's reception was most flattering.
He was given a lodging at Blackfriars
amongst the other painters, and was set
to work immediately for the king.  Charles
was quite as much taken with the courtly
qualities and conversation of his newly-found
painter as by his talent, and greatly enjoyed
his company.  He was accustomed to go
to Blackfriars by water, and to chat with
Van Dyck whilst having his portrait painted.
From this time date the innumerable
portraits of Charles and his Queen, Henrietta
Maria, with which we are so familiar.
</p>

<p>
The fashion thus set by the king was
speedily taken up by his Court, and the
nobility of England competed with one
another for the privilege of having their
portraits painted by the brilliant Fleming.
</p>

<p>
Soon after his arrival Van Dyck received
the honour of knighthood, and, in addition
to being appointed painter to his Majesty,
had an annuity of £200 per annum settled
upon him.
</p>

<p>
The quantity of commissions which now
flowed in upon him was prodigious, and he
was sorely taxed to keep pace with them.
He was enabled in consequence to raise
his prices considerably without in the least
diminishing the patronage bestowed upon
him.  He commenced to entertain on a lavish
scale, and his table was frequented by the
highest in the land.  It is said that after
occupying the morning in painting portraits
he would invite his sitters to dinner, and
then, from the study he had made of their
countenances during the meal, would work
upon the portraits again in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
Although Van Dyck had been accustomed
to good society and living, the overwhelming
good fortune which was now his lot appears
to have developed bad habits in him.  He
soon acquired luxurious habits, which finally
undermined his health.  Passionately fond of
music, he liberally encouraged all the
professors of that art, and gratuitously painted the
portraits of its most celebrated exponents.
</p>

<p>
The demands upon his purse at this time
must have been enormous, and in order to
increase his output, and consequently his
income, he had recourse to the means he
had seen Rubens so successfully employ in
Antwerp.  He brought together a school of
painters, who worked under his directions.
The portraits dating from this period
consequently not only show the marked
deterioration in his technique, but also, beyond the
heads and hands and a few other essential
details, contained but little of his own work.
His assistants were so thoroughly trained
that they were enabled to paint the draperies
and their accessories in a style which welded
perfectly with his own brushwork.
</p>

<p>
These facts have to be carefully remembered
whenever we are contemplating a work
of the English period of Van Dyck, for were we
to form our judgment solely upon the portraits
he had painted prior to going to England we
should reject many of the former as not being
from his hand.  There is further the added
difficulty that his assistants executed pictures
in his manner on their own account, and it is
only by the lack of that spark of genius he
was enabled to infuse in those parts of a
portrait he executed with his own hand that
we are enabled to differentiate between them.
Many of the portraits of the king and queen
which were sent as presents all over Europe
were but the productions of his studio.

<p class="t3">

</p>

<p class="caption">
A remarkably good example of Van Dyck's power of depicting
female character.  Whenever he is faced with a sitter in whom he
is interested he suited his technique to the points he wished to
emphasise.  It is the possession of this versatility which enables
him to infuse so much seductive charm into his women portraits and
such trenchant vigour into those of men.

<p><br /></p>

<hr />

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It is only in such superb presentations of
Charles as that in the Louvre, at Windsor,
and in the National Gallery that we are
enabled to judge of his capabilities at this
period.  He now almost entirely deserted
historical painting.  There was no demand
for it in England, and his attention was
exclusively devoted to portraiture.  Moreover, if we
may judge from the ever-increasing facility
with which he was wont to paint, it may be
fairly said that his attention during these
years was being diverted from painting to
pleasure.  He never lost interest in his art,
but he was impelled to adopt a more facile
manner by the pressure of his engagements
and his ever-increasing expenses.
</p>

<p>
He kept a country house at Eltham in
Kent, where he spent the summer&mdash;a form
of extravagance more defensible than many
in which he was accustomed to indulge.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, he had contracted a marriage
with Mary Ruthven, granddaughter of Lord
Ruthven, Earl of Cowrie, by whom he had
one daughter.  His wife, however, brought
him no dowrie, but was considered one of
the greatest beauties of her time.  Soon
after his marriage he left England with his
wife for the purpose of showing her his
native country.  They travelled for some
time, visiting his family and friends.  Then
the idea occurred to him that he would
proceed to Paris, with a view of sharing, if
possible, in the contemplated decoration of
the Louvre, and thus win laurels equal to
those Rubens had gained by his works in
the Luxembourg.  He arrived, however, too
late: Nicholas Poussin had been brought
specially from Rome for the purpose, and
the work was in hand.  Disappointed in
this, and still desiring to execute some great
work by which he might secure a lasting
renown, he returned to England and
proposed to the king, through the medium of
his old and trusty friend Sir Kenelm Digby,
to embellish the wall of the Banqueting House
at Whitehall with the history of the Order
of the Garter.  The ceiling of this sumptuous
chamber had already been painted by Rubens,
and Van Dyck no doubt considered that his
work would blend admirably with that of
his master.  The sum he asked for, £8000,
although considerable, would no doubt not
have stood in the way of the execution of
the project had it occurred at an earlier date
in the reign of the unfortunate Charles.
The kingdom, however, was already in a
turbulent condition.  Funds were scarce, and
such as existed might have to be employed
at any moment in raising an army to
defend the king's cause.  Charles was now
occupied in a life-and-death struggle with
his people, and had no time to devote to
artistic pursuits.  Van Dyck consequently
waited in vain for an answer, and it is to
be supposed that meanwhile commissions
did not come to him as easily as formerly.
Young as he still was, the effects of his past
luxurious life were beginning to tell upon
him, and, coupled with the disappointment
occasioned by the rejection of his proposal,
contributed to bring on gout.  He began
to have financial worries too, but these can
hardly have been sufficiently great to have
troubled him much, for he left at his death
property to the value of £20,000.  He therefore
turned his attention, probably in emulation,
or by the advice, of his friend Sir Kenelm
Digby, to the pursuit of the philosopher's
stone, and, needless to say, the results of his
experiments and the money he expended
upon them only aggravated the state of his
health.  He rapidly sickened, and died in
London on December 9th, 1641, when forty-two
years of age.  He was accorded a magnificent
funeral in St. Paul's Cathedral, and was
buried in a tomb beside that of John of Gaunt.

<h4>
VAN DYCK'S POSITION IN ART
</h4>

<p>
During the past twenty years the public
has become so educated in matters artistic
that it wishes at once to definitely assign a
certain position to an artist with whose works
it is familiar.  We live in an age of
comparison, and as opportunities for its exercise,
owing to the cheapening of travel, are
so manifestly improved of recent years, a
more just estimation exists in the mind of
the public regarding an artist's worth than
formerly.  Van Dyck, as I said at the
beginning of the opening chapter, has never fallen
from the high position he occupied in his own
day.  He has always appealed to the student
and the artist of every nationality, and if we
survey portrait painting since his day, we
shall see that he has exercised more influence
than any other artist who has ever lived.  It
may be said that Titian, for a couple of
centuries after his death, was the idol almost
exclusively worshipped, and that during the
last fifty years Velazquez and Rembrandt
have been the ideals painters have dangled
before the public and themselves.  But both
of these mighty masters have had their
ups and downs.  The genius of Rembrandt
was certainly not appreciated until the end of
the eighteenth century, and even then his
stupendous powers were not recognised as
they have been in our own day.
</p>

<p>
The worship of Velazquez is quite a modern
institution, and it is not at all unlikely, in the
opinion of well-informed critics, that if his
influence, which has now reached a decadent
stage, is not curtailed it will create as much
havoc amongst modern portrait painters as
the example of Constable has had upon
certain phases of landscape painting.
</p>

<p>
It can never be laid to the charge of
Van Dyck that any period of his art has
exercised a permanently baneful influence.
True, immediately after the Restoration, a
school arose, headed by Sir Peter Lely and
Sir Godfrey Kneller, who claimed to have
followed the traditions of Van Dyck.  It
requires, however, but little comparison
between even his later and slighter works and
those of Lely, who was incomparably the
greatest of the portrait painters working in
England in the interval between Van Dyck
and Hogarth, to see how far below Van
Dyck's standard portrait painting had fallen,
and how little of his method there was left
in it.
</p>

<p>
Van Dyck has exercised more influence
in England than abroad.  Many of our
greatest eighteenth-century portrait painters
have largely formed themselves upon his
example.  Gainsborough was the most
conspicuous instance of this.  From his earliest
days he worshipped the great Fleming, and
that the spell never left him may be gauged
from his dying words: "We are all going
to Heaven, and Van Dyck is of the
company."  Even prior to his departure for
Bath, his portraits possessed many of the
qualities of Van Dyck, but after arriving
in the western city, then the centre of
a rich and fashionable world, he had
manifold opportunities of studying his favourite
master.  His brushwork became at once
more refined, his colouring more transparent,
and his method in every way more facile.
Before leaving Bath he had produced
portraits which are worthy to be placed
alongside those of Van Dyck, and after a few
years' residence in London had created those
marvels of the brush which contend for
supremacy with the finest works of the
Fleming.  For example, what portrait of
the latter master could be cited to surpass
the portrait of Mrs. Graham in the Gallery
at Edinburgh, the superb group at Dulwich,
or the "Blue Boy," in the possession of the
Duke of Westminster?
</p>

<p>
Reynolds appears to have worked more
in emulation of Titian than Van Dyck.  He
painted in a solider and apparently slower
manner, and if the slickness&mdash;if I may be
allowed an Americanism&mdash;of the Flemish
master appealed to him, it yet had no visible
effect upon his own technique.
</p>

<p>
The minor masters of our school
demonstrate materially how much they owed to
Van Dyck.  Allan Ramsay and Cotes bear
adequate witness of this.
</p>

<p>
Full justice, however, has not been done
to the good wrought for English art by his
immediate followers and pupils.  It is only
of late years that the portraits of old Stone
are beginning to be sorted out from those
of the later period of Van Dyck.  Stone was
occupied in copying or making replicas of
the portraits of Van Dyck, and so well did
he succeed in his task that, even to this
day, numerous works by him are to be found
in the country houses of England passing
under the name of the great master.

PLATE VIII.&mdash;THE MARCHESE CATTANEO

(In the National Gallery)

<p class="caption">
In spite of its somewhat bad condition this portrait is an excellent
specimen of Van Dyck's Genoese period.  It was achieved about
the same time as the two magnificent pictures in the Scottish
National Gallery, the Lomellini family and the portrait of an
unknown Italian nobleman.  Its recent entry into the National
Gallery filled a gap in our representation of the great Fleming.

Then we have William Dobson, whose
works are worthy of yet more study than has
hitherto been accorded them.  He did not
long survive Van Dyck, dying in 1646 at the
early age of thirty-six.  He was probably the
most gifted of all his pupils, and had he lived
at any other period would probably have
been held in great estimation.  There is an
excellent example of his brush in the National
Gallery, the portrait of Endymion Porter,
groom of the bedchamber of Charles I.  In
many of the other examples strewn about
the country he shows yet a greater approach
to Van Dyck.  Still, the Trafalgar Square
picture is a worthy example of his powers
at his best.  His masculine handling and
sense of colour place him, from a purely
artistic point of view, far above such men as
Lely and Kneller, who followed him.
</p>

<p>
Another painter who wrought excellent
work under the Commonwealth was Robert
Walker.  He was much patronised by Oliver
Cromwell and his party.  He appears to
have been one of the few portrait painters
who flourished at this time.  He acquired
in a remarkable manner the liquid and
transparent style affected by Van Dyck
during his last years in England, and
coupling with this remarkable powers of fidelity,
his portraits possess great attractions for
the artist as well as the student of history.
</p>

<p>
As I have already said, the influence of
Van Dyck upon the painters who flourished
throughout the three succeeding reigns was
a decadent one.  Sir Peter Lely, who came
to England, at the age of twenty-three, with
the Prince of Orange, the son-in-law of
Charles I., was the best of all these men.  He
was born in Westphalia, of Dutch parentage,
and was educated in the school of Pieter
Fransz de Grebber at Haarlem.  But his
entire method was built upon Van Dyck.  He
seems not to have had a bad time under the
Commonwealth, for he was employed to paint
Cromwell's portrait.  It is said that he had
instructions upon this occasion to paint him,
"warts, pimples, and all."  It was not,
however, till Charles II. had ascended the throne
that he reached the zenith of his fame.
Then came the long series of ladies of the
Court with which we are so familiar.  They
are all set in the same artificial setting, a
landscape half conventional, half natural in
feeling, a languid and somewhat haughty
air about the heads, together with draperies
destined to accentuate the artificial
appearance of the whole portrait.  One can see at
a glance that it was from Van Dyck he had
learned the placing and handling of the
heads, hands, and backgrounds, but what a
monotonous procession it is.  In order to
appreciate the superficialities of Lely a
number of his portraits must be seen together.
We then see how monotonous he was, how
few of those qualities he possessed which
go to make up a great artist.  That he had
a considerable amount of technique at his
command can be seen in such portraits as
the "Duchess of Cleveland" in the National
Portrait Gallery, but in others again he fell so
far below this level of excellence, that one is
sometimes tempted to reject many perfectly
glorious pictures as not being from his hand.
</p>

<p>
The art of Lely had attained great
popularity amongst the aristocracy whose
lives called into being the decadent art of
this period.  All who sought the public
favour tried to catch his manner, and hence
arose quite a number of imitators.
Occasionally Lely was surpassed by some of
his scholars.  For example, John Greenhill
absorbed more of the real qualities of Van
Dyck than his master.  The remarkable
portrait in the Gallery of Dulwich College
shows unmistakable signs of genius of a
high order, and had he not fallen into
irregular habits and died at the age of
thirty-two he might have achieved great things.
</p>

<p>
Sir Godfrey Kneller, who followed Lely,
was infinitely inferior to him as an artist.
He claimed, too, to continue the Van Dyck
tradition, but by this time the art of portrait
painting had sunk into such a deplorable
condition, owing to the depravity of public
taste and to the slavish imitation of the
brilliant Fleming, that there are few of his
pictures that appeal in the least to the
artistic sense.  It was not until the great
period of English painting, beginning with
Hogarth, of which I have already spoken,
that the downward career of painting in
this country was finally checked.
</p>

<p>
So far our attention has been devoted
to discovering the visible effect of Van
Dyck's art upon his contemporaries and
followers.  The fact that on the whole his
influence was decadent in this direction
must not allow us to detract from his own
qualities.  We must rather search for the
reasons which caused his art to retain such
a hold upon generations of English painters.
It must not be forgotten that Van Dyck's
profession in England was essentially that
of a portrait painter, and he was employed
by the aristocracy exclusively.  He, indeed,
may be called the aristocratic painter <i>par
excellence</i>, and in this respect does not
yield to either Titian or Velazquez.  It was,
however, when he strayed from his normal
course that he revealed his deficiencies; the
few extant portraits of the lower classes
demonstrate amply how unsuited he was
to portraying any below the upper ranks
of life.  To every plebeian sitter he imparted
an air of gentility and distinction quite out
of keeping.  Until the advent of Wilson and
Gainsborough, portraiture was the sole art,
at any rate, as far as painting is concerned,
that flourished in England.  Its patrons were
all of the upper classes, and the Van Dyck
manner, which by this time had become a
tradition, was recognised by both artists and
sitters as the best suited to their purpose.
It was only in the eighteenth century that
the general financial and educational uplifting
of the middle classes called into being that
naturalist school which finally drove all
others from the field.
</p>

<p>
It is probable, however, that the painters
who worked so slavishly in Van Dyck's
English manner had never become acquainted
with his finest achievements in portraiture.
With few exceptions these were executed
before he settled permanently in England.
</p>

<p>
It is practically certain that Gainsborough,
for example, had never seen such portraits
as the Philippe le Roy and his wife, now
among the greatest treasures of Hertford
House, which date from the years between
1628-32.  It was then that Van Dyck had
reached his maximum development, and it
is by the portraits he made in the ten years
round about this date that he will probably
be judged by posterity.  The facile ease
and silvery liquidity of his latter manner
may have an irresistible charm for those
who have not studied the master very deeply,
but for the artist and the student the works
he had achieved, before success had crowned
his efforts in the same measure that it did
shortly after his arrival here, will ever
remain the standard by which to judge him.
</p>

<p>
At this time he displayed great assiduity
to learn anything he could either from his
predecessors or from his contemporaries.
In this connection it may not be out of
place to relate a story, the truth of which
has frequently been challenged.
</p>

<p>
Having come across some portraits by
Franz Hals, and being very anxious to see
the master at work, he made a journey to
Haarlem.  Upon inquiring at the Dutchman's
studio, he found that Hals was at his usual
tavern.  He accordingly sent word to him
that a stranger was waiting to have his
portrait painted, and that he had but two
hours to give him before leaving the town.
Hals arrived immediately, and, in view of
the shortness of time at his disposal, set to
work with a will.  Van Dyck, who, needless
to say, had not been recognised, remarked,
as Hals was putting on the finishing touches,
that painting seemed a very easy process,
and asked to be allowed to try his hand.
Accordingly they changed places, and Hals
soon perceived that the stranger was no
novice in the handling of the brush.  As the
work proceeded his curiosity became more
and more whetted, and finally, unable to
restrain his curiosity any longer, he went
over to see how the work was progressing.
One can imagine his surprise when he saw
a masterly portrait in process of completion,
and, recognising the handling, immediately
cried out: "Why, you are none other than
Van Dyck, for he alone could have achieved
what you have done."
</p>

<p>
As an historical painter he takes a very
high rank amongst seventeenth-century
masters; he was far ahead in vigour of
treatment and in strength of brushwork of any
of his contemporaries in Italy.  The school
of Bologna, whilst possessing a refinement
he never attained, is effeminate in
comparison with him.  Their very eclecticism
prevented them giving free rein to their fancy,
and consequently the great majority of their
works possess a restraint of feeling, coupled
with a perfection of execution, which neither
Rubens nor Van Dyck surpassed.
</p>

<p>
Van Dyck certainly stands out as the
greatest scholar of Rubens in every way.
His fellow-pupils whom he left behind in
Flanders could not compare with him.  The
works of the cleverest of them, Caspar de
Grayer, appear formal, indeed, when compared
with any of the stupendous religious compositions
still preserved in the great churches of
his native country.  Their chief merit is, as
I have before said, in the exceedingly human
presentment of the subject.  The sense of
physical pain and of human brutality has never
been better treated, and, if at times he carries
this quality to a painful degree, no charge
could be levelled against him on the score
of feebleness or of lack of thoroughness in
making his meaning quite clear.
</p>

<p>
As compared with similar works by
Rubens they possess an interest for us which
the latter cannot always command, by reason
of their being conceived and finished by the
master himself, whereas those of Rubens,
more often than not, were only worked upon
by the master after pupils had carried out
the greater part of the work.
</p>

<p>
Van Dyck's religious and historical
pictures belong to the period of his career
when his execution was at its zenith, and
consequently they possess an extraordinary
degree of interest to the artist.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, to his early years that one
must turn to form a just estimation of his
abilities, and in his finest works he takes his
place beside Titian and Velazquez, Rembrandt
and Holbein, amongst the greatest masters
of portrait painting who have ever lived.
